##Files
	oss.c - the operating system program
	user.c - the user application program
	oss.h - header file containing data structures used in this project
	config.h - header file containing constants
	helper.h, helper.h - define a helper function to use in multiple programs
	queue.h, queue.c - define queue data structure
	linkedlist.h, linkedlist.c - define linked list data structure
	makefile

## How to run the program
	> make
	> ./oss [-p t]
		-p:	Indicate how many processes running at a time
## Remove all executables and object files
	make clean

## Description
	oss.c:
		> oss.c stimulates a memory management module for our operating system. It uses FIFO page replacement algorithms.
		> When a page-fault occurs, it will be necessary to swap in that page. If there are no empty frames, oss.c will select a victim fram based on the FIFO replacement theory. The dirty bit will also be implemented as a part of the page table.
		> oss.c will fork multiple children at random time stimulated by a logical clock that will be updated by oss.c. 
		> In the beginning, oss will allocate shared memory for system data structures, including page table. You can create fixed sized
arrays for page tables, assuming that each process will have a requirement of less than 32K memory, with each page being 1K. The page table should also have a delimiter indicating its size so that the users processes do not access memory beyond the
page table limit. The page table should have all the required fields that may be implemented by bits (preferable) or character data types. You may want to consider the bit fields in struct to implement those bits.Assume that your system has a total memory of 256K		
		> oss.c will monitor all memory references from user processes and if the reference results in a page fault, the user process will be suspended till the page has been brought in. If there is no page fault, oss.c just increments the clock by 10 seconds. In case of page fault, the request is queued for the device and the process to the device.
		> Each request for disk read/write takes about 14ms to be fulfilled.oss.c also log to the file whenever a user process terminates. Every 1 sec passed, oss.c also print the current states of main memory.
	user.c:
		> Each user process generates memory references to one of its locations.
		> When a process needs to generate an address to request, it simply generates a random value from 0 to the limit of the pages that process would have acces to (32). Multiply that page number by 1024 and then add a random offset of from 0 to 1023 to get the actual memory address requested.
		> User process determine if it wants to write or read on the memory based on random number bias towards reading.After user process has every necessary information, it sends the message back to oss.c and wait for the respond
		> Every 1000 memory references, the user process will check if it should terminate. If so, all its memory will be returned to oss and oss will inform its termination
